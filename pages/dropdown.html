				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">What is your action plan for integration after this announcement of transaction approval?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<ul>
<li>There has been a joint integration team in place since we first announced our intention to restructure ownership in December 2015.</li>
<li>Both Dow and Dow Corning leaders have been working together to define the optimal business model and organization design that will ensure the current business continues to run smoothly and in an uninterrupted manner and that the growth and cost synergies are realized.</li>
<li>This team will continue with its work, and we expect the integration process to be completed within 24 months.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">When is this transaction expected to be accretive?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<ul>
<li>The transaction is expected to be accretive to operating earnings per share (EPS), cash flow from operations and free cash flow in the first full year after the close of the transaction.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">What synergies do you expect from the transaction? In what areas? Are these cost or growth synergies? How soon will they be realized?  </div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<ul>
<li>Dow and Dow Corning are in a unique position to capture synergies of $400 million at annual run rates.</li>
<li>We anticipate capturing approximately $300 million in cost synergies within 24 months and approximately $100 million in growth synergies within 36 months of deal closure.</li>  
<li>We anticipate Dow and Dow Corning will be a powerful combination that will accelerate growth. Growth synergies will be realized by growing in key business areas, through cross-selling opportunities and expanded R&amp;D power.</li>
<li>While there will be job impacts resulting from the consolidation of functional roles, we also will see significant savings from the combined purchasing power of large cost areas and opportunities to share expertise across both companies.</li>

					</ul>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">How comfortable are you that the synergies can be realized? </div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<ul>
<li>Leaders from both companies have been highly involved in the joint planning and validation of these targets.</li>
<li>We believe that these are very realistic and achievable synergy estimates, consistent with our prior transactions and others in the sector.</li>
<li>We have a proven track record in integrating businesses and assets resulting from restructuring transactions and acquisitions and creating value from transactions, and we have consistently achieved or exceeded target synergies in transactions.</li>
<li>In addition to the cost synergies, we see significant additional upside from the revenue and other growth synergies resulting from the growth platform created by this powerful combination. </li>
<li>Growth synergies will be realized by growing in key business areas, through cross-selling opportunities and expanded R&amp;D and innovation power.</li>

					</ul>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Based on the synergies that have been announced, what are the anticipated workforce reductions?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>We have not shared a job impact number, and we do not intend to do so on Day 1/June 1.  The process of identifying impacted roles must take place in a careful and thoughtful manner, and the selection process will take time. With the exception of certain key leadership positions (which have already been announced), the vast majority of people decisions will be taking place in the coming weeks now that Dow Corning has joined the Dow family. It is our intention to provide specific details about the number of impacted roles we expect toward the end of the month of June, in compliance with all local laws and regulations.</p>

				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">What will happen to Dow Corning now that the transaction has closed?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<ul>
<li>Externally, to help make the transition as smooth as possible for customers and other key stakeholders, Dow Corning will retain its name in the near term and will transition over time to the Dow brand.</li>
<li>We see this as the best path for growth, as it enables Dow Corning to retain its well-recognized brand within the silicones industry while Dow is afforded the opportunity to branch out into a new technology platform for the Company – silicones – and strengthen its product offerings in key high-growth industry segments such as building and construction, consumer care, transportation, packaging, coatings, electronics and energy, and, over time, transition the Dow Corning brand to the Dow brand.</li>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Will Dow Corning still have a market presence?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Yes, Dow Corning will continue to serve customers through its Dow Corning brand as well as the Xiameter and Molykote trademarks in the near term and will transition over time to the Dow brand. We see this as the best path for growth, as it enables Dow Corning to retain its well-recognized brand within the silicones industry while Dow is afforded the opportunity to branch out into a new technology platform for the Company – silicones – and strengthen its product offerings in key high-growth business areas such as building and construction, transportation, consumer care, coatings, electronics and energy, and, over time, transition the Dow Corning brand to the Dow brand.

The logo will remain on business cards, employee badges, signs, letterhead and stationery, customer invoices and other official business correspondence, etc. As business cards expire, a new option will be available that features the Dow-Dow Corning logo lock-up for employee use. Our goal is to make the transition to the newly restructured ownership as seamless as possible for Dow Corning customers. On Day 1, both companies will be operating business as usual.</p>

					<p>
Dow is a business-led organization, in which the geography implements local strategy and the functions support the business.

				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">How will Dow Corning’s silicones business be integrated into Dow? </div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>On Day 1, Dow Corning becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow. Both Dow and Dow Corning have been working to define the optimal business model and organizational design that will ensure the current business continues to run smoothly and in an uninterrupted manner, while capturing growth and cost synergy commitments in a timely and efficient fashion. The new organizational design will be comprised of two teams: the Run and Grow the Business team and the Integration &amp; Synergies team.</p>
					<p>Under the Run and Grow the Business team, there will be two global businesses: Dow Performance Silicones and Silicones Feedstocks and Intermediates. Dow Performance Silicones, to be led by a global business president, is chartered with ensuring ongoing operations are smooth and uninterrupted for Dow Corning customers through the integration period, while capturing growth synergies via the existing innovation pipeline, new combinatorial chemistries, expanding product offerings, leveraging complementary leadership in end-use applications, leveraging the power of the Dow geographic model, and more. Silicones Feedstocks and Intermediates, to be led by a global business director, is charged with productivity and asset management, instilling best practices to operate the grid more effectively and run to demand with an eye toward contributing to margin expansion via reducing costs in this part of the business. This business director will also serve as the primary point of contact with the Hemlock Semiconductor Group. This two-tiered approach allows us to have a dedicated and separate focus on growth while removing distractions from the day-to-day operations of Dow Corning.</p>

From these foundational values, our mission is clear: “to passionately create innovation for our stakeholders at the intersection of chemistry, biology and physics.” Our vision stems from this mission to build a better Dow and a better world; we seek to “maximize long-term value per share by being the most valuable and respected science company in the world.” Beyond our core values, mission and vision are several defining characteristics of what it means to be a Dow employee. Our passion for safety and ethics is central to how we work. We firmly believe that our work is meaningless if we are unable to do it safely and ethically. For this reason, Dow consistently outperforms safety standards and benchmarks in manufacturing. We expect and nurture leadership in every employee as we challenge each other to be the best. We're an inclusive community highlighted by respect, collaboration, open and honest communication and a diverse culture. Additionally, the Diamond Standard serves as our ethical compass. All employees, from engineers to operators to executives, reaffirm their commitment to the Diamond Standard annually. Additionally, Dow’s 2025 Sustainability Goals affirm the company’s commitment to protecting our planet and establish the company as an industry leader in this space.

				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">When will the Dow Corning organization change freeze be removed?  </div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>The layers of the organization will begin to be communicated in the weeks following close. The current Dow Corning organizational change freeze will be lifted once the majority of the new organization has been communicated.</p>

				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">How is manufacturing structured at Dow?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Manufacturing is part of the Dow global Operations function, along with Engineering Solutions, EH&amp;S, and Emergency Services and Security (ES&amp;S). Manufacturing &amp; Engineering (M&amp;E) is the largest function in Dow, responsible for the safe manufacturing of Dow product. Within Manufacturing, a key role is the Production Leader, who has responsibility to deliver on the functional and business goals at an individual operating unit – what Dow calls a plant and Dow Corning calls a building. </p>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">When will regional leadership be announced?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<ul>
<li>We have announced the post-close business model and organizational design, which includes Dow Performance Silicones and Silicones Feedstocks and Intermediates. In the first weeks after Day 1, the focus will be on putting in place the new organizational structure and key leadership, and ensuring the appropriate alignment of people to the new structure.</li>
<li>Currently, functions (e.g., IT, M&amp;E, Public Affairs, HR, R&amp;D, etc.) and businesses are refining their organizational designs and making staffing plans – taking into account synergy targets. </li>

				<h2 class="tightBottom" style="padding: 10px 20px;">Employee Questions – Integration Overview and Jobs</h2>
				
				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">What will integration look like? How much “integration” will be done to combine the two companies?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<ul>
<li>Generally, Dow Corning will operate like Dow’s other businesses.</li> 
<li>For example, this means, in general, that centralized functional services such as accounting, legal, tax, human resources, public affairs, information systems, etc., will be provided by the relevant Dow functions.</li> 
<li>Dow Corning’s manufacturing facilities will employ Dow’s standardized operating discipline and most effective technology. </li> 
<li>Because the functional organizations differ in some respects, we also anticipate that some functional job roles within Dow Corning may need to be realigned within Dow. For example, Supply Chain is a standalone function at Dow. At Dow Corning, Logistics and Supply Chain is part of Manufacturing and Engineering (MEGO). </li>
<li>Aligning the right people with the right teams is important. Not only does it maximize the productivity of the organization, it also ensures employees are exposed to career development opportunities that best capture their skills and expertise.</li>
<li>As part of our efforts to support a smooth transition, Dow and Dow Corning employees will generally continue to follow many of the human resources policies and programs of their heritage company for a period of time after Day 1. This means that, for the short term, heritage Dow employees will generally follow the current Dow human resources policies and program, and heritage Dow Corning employees will generally follow current Dow Corning human resources policies and programs. Any exceptions will be communicated.</li>
<li>In addition, there will be job impacts as we integrate. The integration team is working with leaders in both companies to determine what job roles will be realigned or consolidated to maximize the effectiveness of the organizations. The intention is to retain the best practices and people from both companies. </li> 
<li>We have not shared a job impact number, and we do not intend to do so on Day 1/June 1.  As we have said, the process of identifying impacted roles must take place in a careful and thoughtful manner.  </li>
<li>We are committed to completing the selection process quickly, but we also owe it to all of our people to do so thoughtfully as well. These are difficult decisions.  </li>
<li>It is our intention to provide specific details about the number of impacted roles we expect toward the end of the month of June, in compliance with all local laws and regulations.</li>
<li>Any individuals affected by these changes will be notified by their supervisors. We will work toward everyone in Dow Corning knowing his or her situation by the end of Q3 2016. Any Dow employees in roles that are impacted also will be made aware of their job situation by the end of Q3. Timelines may vary by country depending on local legal requirements. We are committed to communicating to employees as the process moves forward and to keeping our values of integrity and respect for people at the forefront.</li>

					</ul>
				</div>
				</div>
								
				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Should I do anything differently now that the transaction is complete? </div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>No. For most employees, it will be business as usual on Day 1. Unless you hear otherwise from your supervisor, your role will not change nor will the work that you do on a day-to-day basis. At this point, you should:  </p>
					<ul>
<li>Continue to operate safely. </li>
<li>Deliver business results.</li>
<li>Reliably meet customers’ needs.</li>
<li>Continue to use the same Intranet, workstations (computers), phones, emails and printers.  SAP/ERP systems and reporting tools, as well as internal computer systems applications remain separate. Use the same IT service and support providers.</li>
<li>Retain a high personal commitment to protecting Intellectual Property and locking out workstations when not in use. Company badges should be prominently displayed and guests logged.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">What sort of change will this mean for Dow Corning employees?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>In the short term, for most Dow Corning employees, it will be business as usual on Day 1.  Employees will continue to use the same work processes, computing system, and software applications and tools. However, as the integration moves forward, some employees may experience changes such as new leaders, new organizational structures and reporting lines, new global business unit structure, new work processes, and new HR systems, among others. There is an extensive change management and training program planned to support employees throughout the transition.</p>
					<p>Supervisors will communicate directly with employees if there is any change in job roles or significant changes in work processes. Dow is committed to keeping employees informed throughout the integration process.</p>
				</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">What is the definition of Day 1?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Day 1 is the first day after transaction close, when Dow is the 100-percent owner of Dow Corning. Dow Corning employees become part of the Dow family.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">When and how are decisions about the organization and selection for roles being made?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Functions (e.g., IT, M&amp;E, Public Affairs, HR, R&amp;D, etc.) and businesses are creating their organizational designs and making staffing plans – taking into account synergy targets. Leaders and HR professionals from both heritage companies are participating in this process.  Both companies are working together to ensure the best fit of the organization needs and to integrate the best practices from each organization.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">What are the principles driving decisions related to the organization and staffing?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>This process is not a “clean slate” or “start over” approach for every organization and role. The focus is on reducing roles where there is overlap, staffing any newly created roles, and eliminating roles where necessary. The goal is to minimize disruption to the organization and to customers. Additionally, a review of a representative slate of candidates is an important consideration, as is the cost of implementation (e.g., relocations and expatriate assignments).	</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Will both Dow Corning and Dow employees be reviewed and considered for all positions in the Dow organization or only the open positions?  </div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Employees from both companies will be considered for positions during the Talent Selection Process. The Talent Selection Process focuses on selecting people into the new organization needed to run the combined entity. There are overlaps, which will result in job eliminations. Including the talent from both companies is crucial for long-term success.</p>
				</div>
				</div>
								
				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">When will employees know their employment status?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>We will work toward everyone in Dow Corning knowing his or her situation by the end of Q3 2016. Any Dow employees impacted will also be notified by end of Q3 2016. Timelines may vary by country depending on local legal requirements.</p>
				</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Who will communicate to me if I have a job or not?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Your supervising manager or his/her designee will be involved with all notifications in coordination with HR.</p>
				</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">When will notifications begin?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>For the vast majority of employees, the notification process will begin around the end of June. We will work toward everyone in Dow Corning knowing his or her situation by the end of Q3 2016. Timelines may vary by country depending on local legal requirements. We are committed to communicating to employees as the process moves forward and to keeping our values of integrity and respect for people at the forefront.</p>
				</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">What will my organization look like? Who is my boss?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Our intention is to let you know as soon as possible. But unless you hear otherwise, it’s “business as usual.” We will communicate all changes in advance of their implementation. For now, we should concentrate on working safely and meeting our customers’ needs.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">How are selections made for roles identified? Will there be interviews held for all jobs?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Among others, the following factors are being considered in the talent selection for individual roles:</p>
					<ul>
<li>Current job performance</li>
<li>Relevant work experiences</li>
<li>Critical skills and competencies required in the new organization.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In some, but not all cases, interviews will be necessary to make decisions.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Are factors such as geographic flexibility and dual career situations taken into account in the selection process?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Employees should discuss their individual situation related to such topics with their supervisor.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">How will Dow Corning employees benefit from the new ownership structure?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Employees will benefit from being part of a larger company. The new Dow will be a strong and growing company that can offer employees more opportunities due to its increased scale and geographic scope. The growth of the company will lead to more opportunities and options for employees in the long term.</p>
				</div>
				</div>
								
				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Will Dow Corning employees have the same opportunities as Dow employees?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Employees of Dow Corning’s silicones business will have the same opportunity to carve out a unique and vibrant career as other Dow employees.</p>
					<p>We also believe that being part of a company with increased scale and geographic scope will offer more opportunities for employees over the long term. The new Dow will be able to offer employees more opportunities in an organization with increased scale and geographic scope.  Growth of the company means more opportunities and options for employees in the long term.</p>
				</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Will Dow Corning employees be able to use Dow’s internal posting system (JAS) to apply for jobs after Day 1?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Both Dow and Dow Corning have internal posting systems (Dow: JAS) (DCC: Talent Connection) for open roles.  In the immediate term, these posting systems will continue to operate separately so employees will not have visibility to all open roles on Day 1 across both companies. However, a team is in place working to enable visibility to all open roles at Dow as soon as practical. In the meantime, HR professionals will facilitate review of relevant candidates for open roles across both companies. </p>
				</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">What are “cost reduction synergies”?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Both companies have resources dedicated to doing the same kind of work. These areas of overlap can be combined, resulting in savings, known in the financial world as cost reduction synergies. While <strong>cost</strong> synergies will result in some near-term job impacts, savings will also come from functional synergy captures such as combined purchasing power for large cost areas such as utilities, supply chain, freight, and logistics costs, raw material savings, and opportunities for expertise sharing across both companies.</p>
					<p>There also will be savings with organizational streamlining and the consolidation of central functions. This will likely result in some job impacts. Dow remains committed to its values of integrity and respect for people and to keeping employees informed during this process. All of these things will contribute to a minimum of $300 million in synergies, which we announced December 11, 2015. Dow and Dow Corning also expect to capture another $100 million in growth synergies.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Can you share your plans for growth synergies?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>We anticipate Dow and Dow Corning will be a powerful combination that will accelerate growth. Growth synergies will be realized by growing in key business areas, through cross-selling opportunities and expanded R&amp;D and innovation power.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">How will Dow treat employees if they are involuntarily terminated?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Impacted employees will be eligible for severance and other separation-related benefits, according to their existing company’s program and provided they otherwise meet the requirements of the respective Dow and Dow Corning plans and policies. </p>

				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Can you provide counts of how many employees will be let go or relocated at the various Dow Corning sites?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>No. Until we have finalized the organization design, talent review and selection, and follow integration processes, we will not have the number of people at each site who will be hired, transferred or outplaced. </p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Will any Dow Corning employees be relocated to a Dow site?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>As jobs are being filled through the talent review process, it may be necessary for some Dow Corning employees to move to a Dow site or office and vice versa. Office consolidations will be determined at a later time. </p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">How does the selection process affect non-exempt and hourly employees? (U.S. ONLY)</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>The primary driver in all cases is the job needs of the new organization. In that sense, the selection process for exempt employees and non-exempt employees is the same. In all cases, the Company will comply with its obligations under existing collective bargaining agreements and applicable laws.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">How does the selection process work for contractors at Dow Corning locations?</div>

				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Is relocation required for some employees?</div>

				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">How many open positions will be created by attrition?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>We don’t know. Not all positions opened by attrition will be refilled.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Are severance packages being offered? If so, what are the terms?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>The current policies and practices governing severance remain in place and are in compliance with local laws and regulations. Human Resources professionals and leaders will meet as soon as possible with affected employees (while adhering to applicable national/local labor regulations) to discuss details about severance and other important information. If you are affected, you will have the opportunity to ask questions specific to your situation at that point and at any time after your notification. For affected Dow employees, the applicable Dow separation policy or program will apply. For affected Dow Corning employees, the applicable Dow Corning separation policy or program will apply.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">What if I’m offered a role that I don’t want to take?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>For the most part, employees who decline a role offered are considered a voluntary separation and are not eligible to receive a severance package. An employee who declines a role may be eligible for severance under limited circumstances, including distance of the relocation required and job level reduction, if any. These decisions will be made in accordance with Dow and Dow Corning HR policies or programs and in compliance with each country’s applicable local legislation.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">If my role is being eliminated, can I be considered for another role? Are open jobs listed somewhere?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>It is possible that an employee whose role is eliminated can be considered for a position in another area depending upon specific individual qualifications and past performance.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Can employees “volunteer” for job eliminations and packages?</div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>This is not a voluntary reduction in the workforce and the primary decisions for reductions will be related to synergies, subject to local laws. Please direct any questions to your leader or Human Resources for more discussion.</p>
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">How much notice do employees receive regarding separation: 30 days, 60 days, or some other time frame?</div>

				</div>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Will any positions be outsourced as part of these changes? </div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Today, both Dow and Dow Corning depend on contractors and third-party service providers for many tasks and roles. This will continue in the future. We are currently in the process of determining the specific impact these changes will have on the various functions and departments throughout Dow and the legacy Dow Corning groups.

				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>No. Some employees who are offered jobs in the new Dow will move into their new job immediately and some will not. There will be some employees who are not offered a job in the new Dow, but will be asked to stay on until the integration is complete, up to two years after the close. Timelines may vary based on integration plans per role or function. </p>

					<p>The safety and well-being of our people, the environment, and our local communities is always a top priority and continues to be as we implement integration actions. If you have questions, please ask. We have the EH&amp;S resources to help. We are committed to the vision of zero – no accidents, no injuries, and no environmental harm.</p>
					<p>For the time being, use the EH&amp;S standards and work processes that you currently use. You will be notified well in advance of any changes to standards and processes. We know that Dow Corning employees are just as committed to safety as Dow employees.  So we know you can keep safety as a top priority, even as we implement change. Not only is it doable, safety is our No. 1 priority.</p>

				<div class="faqitem">
				<div class="expandCollapseToggle">Why do we have to change our work processes? </div>
				<div class="expandCollapseContent">
					<p>Earlier this year, every function in both companies reviewed and compared what they considered best practices in Dow Corning, and how they might go about incorporating them into Dow’s work processes. However, standardization ensures that Dow Corning sites can be fully integrated into Dow and that we leverage the power of the global work processes. These are globally standard and reflect our best practices from around the world. They allow us to be the low-cost producer globally, a significant competitive advantage. So while we’ll adopt some Dow Corning practices, we anticipate that we will ultimately use primarily Dow’s work processes. </p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Work safely.</strong>  It is easy to be distracted during major changes, but your health, and that of your fellow workers and people in the communities where Dow operates, must be maintained.</li>
						<li><strong>Deliver outstanding financial results.</strong>  We must meet our financial goals and business results, to maintain our credibility with external stakeholders.</li>
						<li><strong>Support and accelerate our implementation of work process improvements.</strong>  This will make Dow the best possible company we can be.</li>
						<li><strong>Stay focused on the marketplace and our competitors.</strong> We cannot allow the integration of the companies to distract us from the business at hand.</li>
						<li><strong>Be receptive and respectful.</strong>  We both can learn a lot from each other, and together we can help build the world’s leading material science company. Dow people may need to help heritage Dow Corning employees learn Dow’s systems and processes, as well as learn about Dow Corning’s processes. Dow Corning people will need to be open to learning as much as they can about Dow. All of us must treat each other with respect. We all gain as we build a stronger Dow.</li>
						<li><strong>Remain diligent and alert.</strong> We will potentially be working with new people and in new places as we collaborate to manage the change. Make sure you and your guests prominently display your badges and review safety protocols for first-time visits to a building. We want to keep one another – and Company information – safe and secure.  </li>

Dow Corning will continue to serve customers through the Dow Corning brand and through Xiameter and Molykote trademarks in the near term. We see this as the best path for growth, as it enables Dow Corning to retain its well-recognized brand within the silicones industry while Dow is afforded the opportunity to branch out into a new technology platform for the Company – silicones – and strengthen its product offerings in key high-growth end-use applications such as building and construction, transportation, consumer care, packaging, coatings, electronics and energy.</p>
